The cold is gone.  *cough!*  Almost.  We'll need a boring sine table to
do rotations later.  A no-brainer.  Our world has 256 degrees instead
of 360.  The table has "only" 64 values.  Should fit nicely with the
workarounds for multiplying signed integers.  The line drawing needs to
be finished.  Soon, we might see the first tank.

The line drawing IS finished.  It can't do lines longer than 127 pixels,
though.  Enough for the first tank.

I feel like crap about this idea.  The polygon filler will be the most
difficult thing to implement.  It takes a couple of decisions to be
made beforehand.  Therefore, there'll be unfilled polygons for starters.
That way we can hack some nice gameplay and views first.

Just got a cold. No surge of hypermotivation to be expected over the
next couple of days. :(

I picked an 8 by 8 to 16 bit multiplication algorithm.  It's only for
unsigned integers.  Great!  Let's halve the sine table then!
