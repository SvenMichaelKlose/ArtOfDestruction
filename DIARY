Just got the nerves and time to switch the thing to multicolor.  And the
first trick went in: the character colors will be the background colors.
Watching other people's 3D work impressed and confused me.  This game will
have to approach things differently to squeeze everything in.

The fundamental color palette looks hilarious.  It drills into one's mind.
Good start. Gaming is about attention. And mixing fundamentals into
illusions. And something's odd with the taste of my tea...

The cold is gone.  *cough!*  Almost.  We'll need a boring sine table to
do rotations later.  A no-brainer.  Our world has 256 degrees instead
of 360.  The table has "only" 64 values.  Should fit nicely with the
workarounds for multiplying signed integers.  The line drawing needs to
be finished.  Soon, we might see the first tank.

The line drawing IS finished.  It can't do lines longer than 127 pixels,
though.  Enough for the first tank.

I feel like crap about this idea.  The polygon filler will be the most
difficult thing to implement.  It takes a couple of decisions to be
made beforehand.  Therefore, there'll be unfilled polygons for starters.
That way we can hack some nice gameplay and views first.

Just got a cold. No surge of hypermotivation to be expected over the
next couple of days. :(

I picked an 8 by 8 to 16 bit multiplication algorithm.  It's only for
unsigned integers.  Great!  Let's halve the sine table then!
