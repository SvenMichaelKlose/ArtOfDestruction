I feel like crap about this idea.  The polygon filler will be the most
difficult thing to implement.  It takes a couple of decisions to be
made beforehand.  Therefore, there'll be unfilled polygons for starters.
That way we can hack some nice gameplay and views first.

Just got a cold. No surge of hypermotivation to be expected over the
next couple of days. :(
